This is a test project to explore how well [Canopy](https://lefthandedgoat.github.io/canopy/) and [Respawn](https://github.com/jbogard/Respawn) work together.

It runs against a local instance of the [CrisisCheckin](https://github.com/HTBox/crisischeckin) application. 

It uses Canopy to run a test that asserts that the administrator can create a request. It uses Respawn to reset the database to a known state.
